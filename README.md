*WordWebNav*

WordWebNav is an app that converts a Microsoft-Word document to an HTML web-page, with these features:

1) A Navigation pane, with links to the document's headings
1) A header-bar, e.g., for breadcrumbs
1) A center document-frame, with adjustable width, and support for user-comments at the bottom.
1) Fixes for common bugs in Word's HTML, e.g., 
   1. Word-HTML's paragraphs span the browser's width, which makes the paragraphs very difficult to read.
   1. Word-HTML's multi-level bulleted-lists are grossly misaligned, as well as numbered-lists.

**Overview:**

I built WordWebNav to share Word documents on my personal web-site, as HTML web-pages.  Word is a powerful tool for recording technical info.  Word can save a document in HTML format, but I found that for the web-page to be useful, additional features were needed, as well as fixes for common bugs in Word's HTML.

In my Word documents, I almost always use headings.  For Word to be useful, I find its Navigation Pane is essential, as it shows the document outline very clearly, and it provides hyperlinks to the headings.  So, WordWebNav provides this feature, and the others needed for converting a Word document to a useful web-page. 

In creating a personal web-site, I found alternative solutions had problems and limitations.  Most blog software can import Word documents (e.g., WordPress), but formatting problems are not uncommon.  Static web-site generators (e.g., Niklas) tend to be very complicated, don't do everything I want, and are difficult to customize.  

Using WordWebNav, a personal web-site can easily be created, from Word documents.  The web-pages' user-interface is simple, and it provides the features most users need.  To use WordWebNav for a Word document, just save the document in Word HTML-format.  Then, run the WordWebNav program to generate the enhanced web-page.  That web-page can be uploaded to your web-server.
